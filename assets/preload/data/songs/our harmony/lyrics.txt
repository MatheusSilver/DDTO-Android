2456::All this time
2468::I would wait for a chance to be with you
2520::Sing a tune
2534::With me and let's reach for the clouds, in a balloon
2566::The sky knows no bounds
2578::Your hand in mine
2594::Fates intertwined
2610::Through the dark, my voice will be your light
2642::Take the lead, your melody is all I need
2672::Have no fear, let the world feel Our Harmony
2712::
