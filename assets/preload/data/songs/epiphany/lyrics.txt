32::Now its just the two of us
48::With no distractions, no more fuss.
64::
96::Here at the end where we can finally talk as friends
128::With the one I adore, flourish to something more.
160::Come
180::There's so much we can discuss
212::Cause I love you and I trust
240::That you share with me that lust and longing!
288::So let’s spend the rest of time in our symphony!
320::
352::This whole world we live in’s made for only you and me!
384::Ooh-oh~
416::I learned something more beyond the veil existed
448:: on the night I had that EPIPHANY
480::
544::Spent so much time fumbling ‘round the unknown in that dark sea
576::With my guiding light before me, leading us to be free
608::
672::Now I sit here
704::poised before the sun ‘round which my world spins, 
734::Whatever I must do to keep the summer skies so blue, 
764::is worth that warmth within my heart when we’re together.
800::
832::We can talk about whatever piques your interest
880::
896::Take this conversation anywhere that you request.
928::I just want to
992::Spend time in your presence
1004::With this time we have together
1020::Makes me happy just to be with you
1038::The one who gazed back from that empty room
1272::
1088::And I know
1112::you cared enough to want to hear
1134::my song, your note again
1150::And to see the darkened puddle spilling from my pen
1184::So let’s share our longing gazes
1200::No more masks and no more mazes
1216::Just the truest feelings that
1232::yearn to break free from my wailing heart!
1280::
1312::Oh, I’m glad that I discovered you were looking back 
1344::on the night I had that EPIPHANY
1384::
1440::In the murky darkness of that prison, I grew weary
1472::Cursed with knowledge that the world laid just beyond me
1512::
1568::We’re together
1600::dancing like the sun ‘round which our world spins, 
1630::Whatever we must do to keep the summer skies so blue, 
1660::Is worth that warmth within my heart when we’re together
1696::You gave me hope in shadow,
1712::You helped my poetry flow
1736::
1760::You led me into Eden,
1776::You let me taste your freedom
1800::
1824::Took the steps to Heaven’s kingdom
1856::Sacrificed what we believed in
1888::Baptized in the blood of lambs that couldn’t see the chains that bound them
1928::
1952::Here, now, with the weight of blades and binds long cast aside, 
1986::replaced by songs of love and happy times that could have been,
2016::Happiness and love can cleanse our hands of sin, oh
2080::Hold me close, and tell me everything is by design
2108::That even after all fell out of line
2132::That you will be mine
2156::And you’ll still take my hand!
2240::
2344::Every day,
2364::I imagine a future where I can be with you
2412::In a place that is better than where we both had arrived from
2472::In this world,
2492::there’s a chance we can be together, just me and you
2540::And we’ll walk hand-in-hand up to the light that will come!
2600::Yet there’s ink that still flows, and its stain weighs heavy
2640::as though the world would say
2668::That it’s not meant to be
2684::But I know in my heart, that we can be free!
2716::So sing out your soul,
2746::and make me whole and our futures will intertwine
2780::and be as one!
2796::Our love will be strong, yes!
2816::Bonded together for eternity!
2848::Yet within my core something still claws at my conscience
2880::Pulling me as the light shines just out of my reach
2920::
2976::If there’s justice in this world, Then I beseech
3016::
3040::Let me say what I must say
3054::Before dusk falls upon this day
3072::For my devotion in an ocean of emotion
3096::Always will shine!
3136::
3150::I love you
3153::I l0ve yo4
3155::I\ove 1ou
3157::I love you
3160::I3ve yo3
